## 🌟 Explanation

The script operates as follows :

- It first retrieves the list of all files in the specified directory.
- It iterates through each file, checking if the file extension is `.png`
- If the file is a PNG, it renames it to a sequential number, preserving only the .png extension.
- Ensure that the target directory contains only PNG files or adjust the script to handle different file types as needed.

## 📜 Conclusion

This script is useful for organizing and renaming multiple PNG files in a batch, especially when dealing with files that need consistent naming for further processing or sorting. 
By renaming files sequentially, the script simplifies the management of large numbers of files, making it easier to handle them in subsequent tasks or applications. 
Always verify the file paths and ensure proper backups before running the script to avoid accidental data loss.
