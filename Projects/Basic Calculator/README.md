## Simple calculator

Create a simple calculator program in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should prompt the user to input two numbers and then select an operation. Based on the user's choice, the program should perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and display the result.

## 🌟 Requirements
The calculator should support the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

<br>

The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully, including non-numeric input for numbers and invalid operation selections.
Division by zero should be handled with an appropriate error message.

## ❔ Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Select an operation: 
 1 : Add
 2 : Subtract
 3 : Multiply
 4 : Divide
3
Result: 50
```

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Install Python 3 to run the code.
