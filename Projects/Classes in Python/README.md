# Classes in Python

## ðŸŒŸ Description
This Python program demonstrates the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using classes, inheritance, and decorators. The program defines a parent class `Employee` and an inherited class `Programmer` to showcase how different types of employees can be managed and their information displayed.

## ðŸ”° Features

### ðŸ’  Parent Class: Employee
The `Employee` class serves as the parent class with basic attributes and methods.

#### ðŸ”¹ Constructor
The constructor initializes an `Employee` object with the following attributes:
- `name`: The name of the employee.
- `occupation`: The occupation of the employee.
- `networth`: The net worth of the employee.

#### ðŸ”¹ Decorator
The `greet` decorator function adds welcome and farewell messages around the execution of the `info` method.

#### ðŸ”¹ Functions inside the class
- `info(self)`: This method prints the employee's name, occupation, and net worth.

### ðŸ’  Inherited Class: Programmer
The `Programmer` class inherits from the `Employee` class and adds additional functionality.

#### ðŸ”¹ Methods
- `showlang(self)`: This method prints the programming language the programmer codes in (default is Python).

## ðŸ”° Usage

### ðŸ’  Creating Employee Objects
You can create instances of the `Employee` class with the following code:
```python
a = Employee("Harry", "Developer", 10000)
b = Employee("Riyan", "HR", 15000)
c = Employee("Shubham", "Sales Manager", 25000)
```

### ðŸ’  Displaying Employee Information
To display the information of each employee, use the `info` method:
```python
a.info()
b.info()
c.info()
```

### ðŸ’  Creating Programmer Objects
You can create instances of the `Programmer` class, which inherits from `Employee`:
```python
d = Programmer("Jake", "Developer", 60000)
```

### ðŸ’  Displaying Programmer Information
To display the information and programming language of a programmer, use the `info` and `showlang` methods:
```python
d.info() 
d.showlang()
```
