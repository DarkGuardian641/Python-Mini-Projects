## Snake Water Gun

Snake, Water and Gun is a variation of the children's game "rock-paper-scissors" where players use hand gestures to represent a snake, water, or a gun. 
The gun beats the snake, the water beats the gun, and the snake beats the water.
Write a python program to create a Snake Water Gun game in Python using if-else statements. 
Do not create any fancy GUI. Use proper functions to check for win.

<br>

The game has simple rules :
- Snake beats Water.
- Water beats Gun.
- Gun beats Snake.

<br>

The objective is to create a Python program that allows a user to play Snake, Water and Gun against the computer.

- Compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the winner based on the game rules.
- Display the result to the user along with user's and computer's choice.
