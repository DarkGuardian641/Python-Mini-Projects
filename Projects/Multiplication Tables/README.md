## 🌟 Explanation

- In mathematics, a multiplication table (sometimes, less formally, a times table) is a mathematical table used to define a multiplication operation for an algebraic system.
- The decimal multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part of elementary arithmetic around the world, as it lays the foundation for arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers.
- In this code we can find the multiplication table of any number.
- We can also find tables of float values (decimal numbers)
