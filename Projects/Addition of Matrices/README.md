## 🌟 Explanation

- Addition of matrix is the basic operation performed, to add two or more matrices. 
- Matrix addition is possible only if the order of the given matrices are the same. 
- By order we mean, the number of rows and columns are the same for the matrices. 
- Hence, we can add the corresponding elements of the matrices. But if the order is different then matrix addition is not possible. 
- Suppose A = [aij]ₘₓₙ and B = [bij]ₘₓₙ are two matrices of order `mxn`, then the addition of A and B is given by A + B = [aij]ₘₓₙ + [bij]ₘₓₙ = [aij + bij]ₘₓₙ
