## 🌟 Explanation

- A cylinder's surface area and volume are important geometric properties. 
- The surface area includes the areas of the two circular bases and the rectangular side that wraps around. 
- The volume is the space contained within the cylinder. 
- Given the radius r and height h of the cylinder, your task is to write a Python code that computes these values.
- Use volume of the cylinder is (π r² h), and its surface area is ((2π r h) + (2π r²))
