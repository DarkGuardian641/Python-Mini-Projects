## üåü Description
This project visualizes the performance of various IPL (Till Indian Premier League 2022) teams in terms of matches won and lost.
This project consists of two Python scripts:

- Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the scripts:
    - `pandas`
    - `matplotlib`

- You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Save each script in a separate `.py` file, for example, `matches_won.py` and `matches_lost.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the scripts.
4. Run each script using the following commands:

```sh
python matches_won.py
```

```sh
python matches_lost.py
```

<br>

## üì∫ Output and Visualizations

- **Matches Won**: Displays a bar chart showing the number of matches won by each team.
- **Matches Lost**: Displays a bar chart showing the number of matches lost by each team.
