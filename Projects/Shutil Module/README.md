## üåü Explanation

#### The following are some of the most commonly used functions in the shutil module:

- `shutil.copy(src, dst)` : This function copies the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original file will be overwritten.

- `shutil.copy2(src, dst)` : This function is similar to shutil.copy, but it also preserves more metadata about the original file, such as the timestamp.

- `shutil.copytree(src, dst)` : This function recursively copies the directory located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original directory will be merged with it.

- `shutil.move(src, dst)` : This function moves the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. This function is equivalent to renaming a file in most cases.

- `shutil.rmtree(path)` : This function recursively deletes the directory located at path, along with all of its contents. This function is similar to using the rm -rf command in a shell.
