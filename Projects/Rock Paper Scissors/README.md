## Rock Paper and Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. 
These shapes are "rock," "paper," and "scissors." 

<br>

The game has simple rules :
- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beats paper.
- Paper beats rock.

<br>

The objective is to create a Python program that allows a user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

## 🌟 How it works

- The program should prompt the user to input their choice: "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
- The program randomly generate the computer's choice from the same set of options.
- Compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the winner based on the game rules.
- Display the result to the user along with user's and computer's choice.
