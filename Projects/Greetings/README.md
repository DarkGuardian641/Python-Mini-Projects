## Time Based Greeting

Create a Python script that greets a user based on the local machine time. The greeting should be appropriate for the time of day, specifically morning, afternoon, or evening. 
Use the time module to retrieve the current local time and determine the appropriate greeting.

## Requirements

### Greeting Logic :

- If the current time is between 05:00 and 12:00, the script should greet the user with "Good Morning!"
- If the current time is between 12:00 and 17:00, the script should greet the user with "Good Afternoon!"
- If the current time is between 17:00 and 21:00, the script should greet the user with "Good Evening!"
- Else the script should greet the user with "Good Night!"
- The script should prompt the user to enter their name.

## Prerequisites

- Install Python 3 to run the code.
- Familiarity with the time module for retrieving and working with time information.

## How to Run

```python3
  python3 greetings.py
```
