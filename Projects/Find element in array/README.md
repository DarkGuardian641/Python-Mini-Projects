## Find element in given array and give its index position

There is a given array. If the number entered by the user exists in that array, it prints its index position, otherwise the code returns element not found.

## 🌟 How it works

- Initialize the array.
- Prompt the user to enter a number and store it in the variable n.
- Iterate through the array.
- Loop through each element in the array using a for loop, with ele representing the index.
- Check for the number.
- If the number is found, print the index of the number and exit the loop using break.
- If the loop completes without finding the number (i.e., the else block of the loop is executed), print "Element not found".

## 📜 Conclusion

- The algorithm efficiently searches for a user-specified number within a predefined array.
- If the number is found, it prints the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, it informs the user that the number is not present in the array.
- This approach ensures a straightforward and clear method to locate an element in an array, demonstrating basic principles of iteration and condition checking.
